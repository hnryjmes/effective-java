# Effective Java

#### Third Edition

### by Joshua Block

`Notes by Henry Cooksley`

### 1 Introduction

"This book is not intended to be read from cover to cover: each item stands on its own, more or less."

"This book is not for beginners: it assumes that you are already comfortable with Java."

"Most of the rules in this book derive from a few fundamental principles."

"Clarity and simplicity are of paramount importance."

"The user of a component should never be surprised by its behavior."

"Components should be as small as possible but no smaller."

"Code should be reused rather than copied."

"The dependencies between components should be kept to a minimum."

"Errors should be detected as soon as possible after they are made, ideally at compile time."

"Learning the art of programming, like most other disciplines, consists of first learning the rules and then learning when to break them."

"The language supports four kinds of types: interfaces (including annotations), classes (including enums), arrays, and primitives."

"The first three are known as reference types."

"Class instances and arrays are objects; primitive values are not."

"A class's members consist of its fields, methods, member classes, and member interfaces."

"A method's signature consists of its name and the types of its formal parameters; the signature does not include the method's return type."
